# Worse-Pose-but-Better-3DGS

## Project Overview
This project, titled "Worse-Pose-but-Better-3DGS", is designed to [Describe in detail the core objective or main function here. For instance, it focuses on leveraging specific algorithms or techniques to reconstruct a more accurate and detailed 3D geometric structure even when dealing with input data having relatively poor poses. The methodology might involve advanced image processing, pose estimation refinement, or other innovative approaches.]

## Installation Instructions
To set up the environment for this project, you need to install several components. Here are the links and brief descriptions for each of them:

### Windows 11 with WSL2
- **Link**: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- **Description**: Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) allows you to run a Linux environment natively on your Windows 11 system. Follow the official Microsoft documentation provided in the link to install and configure WSL2 properly. This step is crucial as our project relies on a Linux-based environment for many of its operations.

### Anaconda

- **Description**: Anaconda is a popular platform for managing Python environments and packages. Use the installation guide on the provided link to install Anaconda on your system. It will help you create isolated environments for our project and manage the necessary Python libraries efficiently.

### ROS-noetic
- **Link**: [https://wiki.ros.org/noetic#Installation](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic#Installation)
- **Description**: The Robot Operating System (ROS) in its noetic version is an essential part of our project for handling robotic-related tasks, such as sensor data processing, robot control, and more. Refer to the ROS wiki link for detailed installation instructions to get ROS-noetic up and running on your system.

### ORBSLAM3
- **Link**: [https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3)
- **Description**: ORB_SLAM3 is a state-of-the-art Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) library. It plays a significant role in our project for tasks like mapping the environment and localizing within it. Visit the GitHub page to learn about its installation process, which may involve cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and compiling the code.

### MONOGS
- **Link**: [https://github.com/muskie82/MonoGS](https://github.com/muskie82/MonoGS)
- **Description**: The MONOGS project implements a dense SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which won the highlight and best demo award at CVPR 2024. It for the first time demonstrates a monocular SLAM method solely relying on 3D Gaussian Splatting, mainly utilizing the gradient propagation with camera poses.

Please follow the installation guides provided by each respective link carefully to ensure a smooth setup of the project environment.
